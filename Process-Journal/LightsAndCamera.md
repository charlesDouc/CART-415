## Ideas  // 01.15.18

Before getting into it, I must confess that I don't like the type of game that TANKS! tries to be. I find the game **blend** and **déjà vu** without having any particular eye candy features. My goal in this project (as for all other porjects this semester) is to **disamble** TANKS! and transform the game in something completly different and exploiting new mechanics to create (or test) a **unique** user experience.
